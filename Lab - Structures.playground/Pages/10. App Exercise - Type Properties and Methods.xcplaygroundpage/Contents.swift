//:  It may be helpful to have a few type properties on `RunningWorkout` representing unit conversions (i.e. meters to mile, feet to meters, etc.). Go back and add a type property for `meterInFeet` and assign it 3.28084. Then add a type property for `mileInMeters` and assign it 1600.0. Print both of these values below.
import Foundation

struct RunningWorkout {

}

print("1 meter is \(RunningWorkout.meterInFeet) feet.")
print("1 mile is \(RunningWorkout.mileInMeters) meters.")
